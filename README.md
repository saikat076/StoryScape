# Template Folder Project

This repository contains a project structured under a `template` folder that includes HTML files with inline CSS and a `resource` folder for images. This README file will provide an overview of the project structure, usage, and any other relevant details.

## Project Structure

- **template**: This folder contains all the HTML files with inline CSS for your project.
- **template/resource**: Inside the `template` folder, this folder houses the images used in the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `template` folder:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo/template
    ```

3. Open the HTML files in your preferred browser to view the project.

## Usage

The HTML files inside the `template` folder can be opened directly in your web browser. Simply double-click on an HTML file to view it. All CSS styling is included inline within each HTML file, so there are no external CSS files to manage.

### Resource Folder

- The `resource` folder contains images used throughout the HTML files. 
- When modifying the HTML files, be sure to reference images in the `resource` folder correctly.
